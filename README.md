# 🎬 Flexify

Flexify is a Flutter-based mobile application that lets users browse movies, view trailers, and explore trending content — a YouTube-style app, but focused entirely on movies. It uses the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for movie data and integrates YouTube trailers seamlessly.
